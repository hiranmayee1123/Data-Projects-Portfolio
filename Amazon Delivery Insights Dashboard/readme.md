# Amazon Delivery Insights Dashboard

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard designed to analyze Amazon-style delivery insights using the Northwind dataset adapted for MongoDB. The dataset has been formatted to help visualize order trends, delivery performance, customer insights, and product metrics.

## Dataset: Northwind@MongoDB

### Overview

The Northwind dataset provides a classic relational dataset representing a simplified version of an e-commerce system. Originally used in SQL, this dataset is adapted for MongoDB and structured for use in Tableau to create insightful visualizations similar to Amazonâ€™s delivery analytics.

### What This Dataset Includes

- **CSV Data**: CSV files for entities such as orders, products, customers, and employees, to simulate Amazon-style analytics.
- **Import Script**: A MongoDB import script (`mongo-import.sh`) to load data directly into MongoDB.

## Requirements

1. **Tableau Desktop**: For creating and viewing the Tableau dashboard.
2. **MongoDB** (Optional): Required only if you plan to load and manipulate the data directly in MongoDB.
3. **MongoDB Data Connector for Tableau** (Optional): Allows direct connection to MongoDB for real-time analysis.
