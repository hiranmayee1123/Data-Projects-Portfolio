        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>The analysis of ChatGPT's user growth was carried out using Power BI. Key visualizations and reports were created to explore various aspects of user growth, including:</p>
        <h3>1. Time to Reach 1 Million Users</h3>
        <p>A comparative visualization showing how quickly ChatGPT reached 1 million users, compared to other popular online services like Instagram, Dropbox, and Netflix. ChatGPT achieved this milestone in just five days, setting a new record for rapid user adoption.</p>

        <h3>2. User Growth by Time Period</h3>
        <p>A line chart illustrating the user growth trends across specific time periods. This segmentation allows for a clearer understanding of how user growth accelerated since the platform's launch and includes a forecast for future growth from April to July 2023.</p>

        <h3>3. User Growth by Geography</h3>
        <p>Visualizations were used to analyze the geographical distribution of ChatGPT users. This helped identify regions where ChatGPT has the highest adoption, providing insights into the platform's global reach.</p>

        <h3>4. Proportion of Traffic</h3>
        <p>Analysis of the sources of traffic driving ChatGPT's user growth, revealing the contribution of various channels to the overall increase in users.</p>
