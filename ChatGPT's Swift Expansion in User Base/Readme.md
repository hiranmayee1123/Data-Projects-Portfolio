# ChatGPT's Swift Expansion in User Base

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the rapid growth in the user base of ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI, using Power BI. The data for this analysis was scraped from the website [Exploding Topics - ChatGPT Users](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users). The collected data was cleaned and visualized to generate insights into the user growth trends of ChatGPT over time.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to understand the growth patterns of ChatGPT's user base. Using Power BI, I created visualizations that offer clear insights into how the user count has evolved over time and provide projections for its future trajectory.

## Data Collection
The data for this analysis was gathered by scraping the relevant information from [Exploding Topics - ChatGPT Users](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users). This dataset includes attributes such as dates, user counts, and additional context about the growth of ChatGPT users.

## Analysis
### 1. Time to Reach 1 Million Users
A comparative visualization showing how quickly ChatGPT reached 1 million users, compared to other popular online services like Instagram, Dropbox, and Netflix. ChatGPT achieved this milestone in just five days, setting a new record for rapid user adoption.

### 2. User Growth by Time Period
A line chart illustrating the user growth trends across specific time periods. This segmentation allows for a clearer understanding of how user growth accelerated since the platform's launch and includes a forecast for future growth from April to July 2023.

### 3. User Growth by Geography
Visualizations were used to analyze the geographical distribution of ChatGPT users. This helped identify regions where ChatGPT has the highest adoption, providing insights into the platform's global reach.

### 4. Proportion of Traffic
Analysis of the sources of traffic driving ChatGPT's user growth, revealing the contribution of various channels to the overall increase in users.

## Insights
Several important insights emerged from the analysis of ChatGPT's user growth:
- **Rapid User Growth**: ChatGPT's user base has seen rapid expansion, achieving 1 million users in just five days and growing to 1.8 billion users. A Power BI forecast suggests this will rise to approximately 2.9 billion by July 2023.
- **Direct Traffic**: The majority of user growth has been driven by direct traffic (87.89%), highlighting a strong organic presence and customer loyalty.
- **Geographical Adoption**: The USA has shown significant user adoption, establishing itself as the largest market for ChatGPT.
- **User Engagement**: On average, users spend 8 minutes and 32 seconds interacting with ChatGPT, reflecting the platform's ability to capture and sustain user interest.

## Installation
